# Seismic_BPMF

Complete framework for earthquake detection and location with GPU-accelerated processing.

Backprojection and matched-filtering (BPMF) is a two-step earthquake detection workflow with 1) backprojection for template finding and 2) template matching for lowering the magnitude of completeness of the catalog. BPMF offers a number of routine for the automatic location of the detected events with the deep neural network phase picker [PhaseNet](https://github.com/wayneweiqiang/PhaseNet) and the earthquake locator [NLLoc](http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/). BPMF leverages the low-level C and CUDA-C programming languages for the efficient processing of large data volumes. The core routines for backprojection and template matching are provided in our two packages [beampower](https://github.com/ebeauce/beampower) and [fast_matched_filter](https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter), respectively.  

`BPMF` v2.0.0-alpha is now out! Checkout the online tutorial at [https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/tutorial](https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/tutorial) to learn how to use our fully automated workflow and build your own earthquake catalog.

## Documentation

Check out the online documentation at [https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/index.html](https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/index.html).

## Installation

Download or clone the repository. Go to the root folder, activate your virtual
environment, and execute the following command lines:
```shell
    python setup.py build_ext
    pip install .
```
The first line, `python setup.py build_ext`, executes the Makefile and compiles the C and CUDA-C librairies. If you don't have an Nvidia GPU and/or the nvcc compiler, you will see a warning message (and every time you will load the BPMF librairy). You can still use BPMF on CPUs. 


Details on how to set up a working environment at [https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/tutorial/general.html](https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/tutorial/general.html).

If you use this package for your research.

Note: Our paper Beaucé et al., 2022 (see References below) was prepared with
BPMF v1.0.1, than you can find at
[https://github.com/ebeauce/Seismic_BPMF/releases/tag/v1.0.1](https://github.com/ebeauce/Seismic_BPMF/releases/tag/v1.0.1).


## To do:
- [ ] Convert `availability` and `source_receiver_dist` to properties.
- [ ] Robust and fast detection threshold for template matching.
- [ ] Use Seisbench for the easier interfacing of ML pickers.
- [ ] Convert `moveouts` and `weights` to xarray-like objects with explicit
  indexing using station names? 
- [ ] Update notebooks and doc.
